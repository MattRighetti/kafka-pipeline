# Apache Kafka Data Processing Pipeline 
## Features
- Provide administrative tools / scripts to create and deploy a processing pipeline that processes
messages from a given topic.
- A processing pipeline consists of multiple stages, each of them processing an input message
at a time and producing one output message for the downstream stage.
- Different processing stages could run on different processes for scalability.
- Messages have a key, and the processing of messages with different keys is independent.
- Messages having the same key are processed in FIFO order with end-to-end exactly once
delivery semantics.
